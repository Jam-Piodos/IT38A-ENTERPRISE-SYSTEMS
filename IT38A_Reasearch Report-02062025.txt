and gave advice.

Hershey is a big chocolate company. They wanted a new system before Y2K to make things
run smoother and to help their supply chain. But things didn’t go well.

which made things worse.

a good team to set it up properly and train employees well. Doing
things step by step prevents big problems.

to avoid problems. Keep supporting employees after the system starts.
